Liman MYS | Firewall Extension

This extension is a basic Firewall management tool on the Linux servers. Through this extension, UFW may be enabled or disabled. Also, the number of listening port and number of firewall rules can be viewed. The UFW extension also shows listening ports on the server and enables users to allow or block. If user wants to add a custom firewall rule, he/she can benefit from the "Firewall Rules" tab. In addition, all created rules can be viewed and deleted under the "Firewall Rules" tab.
